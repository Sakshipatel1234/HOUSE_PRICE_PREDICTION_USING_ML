INTRODUCTION:
In this project, House price prediction we had taken a dataset named as USA_HOUSING which has data from USA. we had worked on that dataset. I had used machine learning Algorithm for evaluation.

Steps Involved:
Importing the required packages into our python environment
Importing the house price data and do some EDA on it
Data Visualization on the house price data
Feature Selection & Data Split
Modeling the data using the algorithms
Evaluating the built model using the evaluation metrics
Let’s now jump into our coding part!

Importing required packages
Our primary packages for this project are going to be pandas for data processing, NumPy to work with arrays, matplotlib & seaborn for data visualizations, and finally scikit-learn for building an evaluating our ML model. Let’s import all the required packages into our python environment.
